# Object-Detection-and-Segmentation-YOLOv8

This project demonstrates **object detection** and **segmentation** on images using **Ultralytics YOLOv8** models. It predicts objects and segments regions in a sample image (`bus.jpg`), saving the results in organized folders.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The project highlights:

- **Object Detection:** Using `yolov8n.pt`  
- **Object Segmentation:** Using `yolov8n-seg.pt`  
- **Automatic Output Saving:** Results are stored in organized folders  

### Key Features

- Detection of objects in images  
- Segmentation of object regions  
- Outputs saved in `runs/detect/` and `runs/segment/`  
- Easy to run with a single Python script
