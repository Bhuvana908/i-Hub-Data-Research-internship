## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics & Graph Analysis

After training the YOLOv8 model, several evaluation metrics and graphs are generated to measure detection and segmentation performance. Below is a brief explanation of each:

## ðŸ“ˆF1-Confidence Curve

!(F1)(runs/Results-after-training/Evaluation-metrics/BoxF1_curve.png)

The F1â€“Confidence curve shows how the modelâ€™s F1 score (balance between precision and recall) changes with different confidence thresholds.

In this graph: The overall F1 score peaks at 0.88 when the confidence is around 0.489, indicating this is the optimal threshold for best detection performance across all classes.
