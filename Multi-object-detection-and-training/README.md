## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The project highlights:

- **Object Detection:** Bounding boxes around multiple objects  
- **Object Segmentation:** Colored masks over detected objects  
- **Performance Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score, mAP, Confusion Matrix  

### Key Insights

- Detection and segmentation results on validation images  
- Class-wise performance evaluation  
- Training and validation results visualized through plots  
- Metrics for overall model performance and class distinctions

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Download the full dataset from Kaggle:  
   [Vehicle Dataset for YOLO](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadinpethiyagoda/vehicle-dataset-for-yolo)
3. Place the dataset in the following structure:

   dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ labels/
â””â”€â”€ valid/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â””â”€â”€ labels/

4. Run detection and segmentation on sample images:

\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

5. Check **runs/** folder for detection, segmentation, and training results.
